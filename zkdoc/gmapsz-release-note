     is sent the org.zkoss.gmaps.event.MapMouseEvent instead when

  2. To distinguish whether Gmarker is draggable only inside Gmaps,
     a new method setDraggingEnabled() is added into Gmarker. If
	 setDraggingEnabled to true, then the Gmarker can be draggable
	 only inside Gmaps as it was. If setDraggingEnabled to false,
	 then the Gmarker can be dragged outside the Gmaps and drop
	 onto other ZK components provided proper draggable property
	 is set (by calling setDraggable) .
